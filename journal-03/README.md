## Dribbble's Interface

As a designer, I use certain resources to help me find inspiration behind what I create. One of these platforms includes Dribbble. Dribbble serves as a site that allows creatives to share upload and their designs to get feedback and interact with other designers. Dribbble creates a community of designers by serving as the the go-to resource for discovering and connecting fellow creatives around the world. I was first introduced to Dribbble my second year of college and I was immediately impressed by it's *satisfying* layout and easy to navigate interface.

Recently, I have been more active on Dribbble and have been dedicating more screen time to scroll through fellow designers works. Not only because its enjoyable to view others work but because it helps me find the inspiration I need to create. In fact, a large majority of my inspiration for the final Xd prototype in this class came from dribble. Let's take a closer look at dribbble's interface. Upon arrival to the home page, users are greeted with a navigation bar located in the top left corner, followed bellow by another navigation bar that allows them to categorize their search. This serves as an *effective* tool because it allows users to quickly access what they are searching for. Also located on the home page are "shots" from designers that you follow and if nothing was posted recently, dribbble will place popular "shots" for your viewing. Often times I find myself scrolling through the popular section as I like to see what is currently trending. This serves as an *effecient* way to stay on top of the latest design trends.

Not only does dribbble serve as a resourceful tool for designers, but it also functions as a platform where designers can search for work. Located at the top navigation bar, users are given the option to select the "for designers" tab. A drop down then appears to show the options: job board, freelance projects, and go pro. These all serve as valuable tools for designers to utilize. Because dribbble offers more than just inspiration for users, but also also offers the ability to find potential employeement/side gigs, dribbble is a powerful, highly *usable* platform in the design industry. Dribbble focuses on optimizing the way users find inspiration and how they connect with fellow designers. Because this is their main goal, the interface is strategically layed out so it is *memorable* to the users. They keep it simple, using a grid layout and system of hierarchy to properly label categories as well as to make navigating the site *error tolerant*.

Personally, dribbble has been a game changer for myself as a designer. No matter what project I am working on I can always rely on dribbble to find inspiration. In the future, as I gain more experience and confidence, dribbble will not only serve as a place where I can search for inspiration but as a platform where I can share my designs.
