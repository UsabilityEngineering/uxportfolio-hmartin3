## Dribbble 

As a designer, I use certain resources to help me find inspiration behind what I create. One of these platforms includes Dribbble. Dribbble serves as a site that allows creatives to share upload and their designs to get feedback and interact with other designers. Dribbble creates a community of designers by serving as the the go-to resource for discovering and connecting fellow creatives around the world. I was first introduced to Dribbble my second year of college and I was immediately impressed by its satisfying layout and easy to navigate interface.

Recently, I have been more active on Dribbble and have been dedicating more screen time to scroll through fellow designers works. Not only because its enjoyable to view others work but because it helps me find the inspiration I need to create. In fact, a large majority of my inspiration for the final Xd prototype in this class came from dribble. Let's take a look at dribbbles interface.
