Zoom's Interface

Haley Martin April 12, 2020

Due to COVID 19, college students have abandoned the classrooms and switched to a virtual learning environment in order to complete their classes. This switch to online learning has been a challenge for most, but with the help of Zoom, students are able to connect with their peers and professors. Zoom is a video communications platform that allows people with mobile devices, computers, and tablets to connect via audio and video conferencing. Zoom has served as a very helpful tool during the pandemic and has allowed for people to still feel connected in this time of social distancing. 

The goal of Zoom is to make video communications frictionless. After downloading the software on your computer and signing up with an email, it directs you to the homepage. From the homepage, you can start a new meeting, join a meeting, view your schedule, or share your screen. (insert image) These are the four main features of zoom and having them displayed on the homepage communicates to users what they are expected to do next. This direct layout makes the interface learnable. The icons used to display these actions are easily identifiable; therefore making the interface easy to navigate.
