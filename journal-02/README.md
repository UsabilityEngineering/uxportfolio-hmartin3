Zoom's Interface

Haley Martin April 12, 2020

Due to COVID 19, college students have abandoned the classrooms and switched to a virtual learning environment in order to complete their classes. This switch to online learning has been a challenge for most, but with the help of Zoom, students are able to connect with their peers and professors. Zoom is a video communications platform that allows people with mobile devices, computers, and tablets to connect via audio and video conferencing. Zoom has served as a very helpful tool during the pandemic and has allowed for people to still feel connected in this time of social distancing. 

The goal of Zoom is to make video communications frictionless. After downloading the software on your computer and signing up with an email, it directs you to the homepage. From the homepage, you can start a new meeting, join a meeting, view your schedule, or share your screen. The overall design of the homepage is very clean and simplistic, making it **satisying** to use.

These are the four main features of zoom and having them displayed on the homepage communicates to users what they are expected to do next. This direct layout makes the interface **learnable**. The icons used to display these actions are easily identifiable; therefore making the interface easy to navigate. Located at the top is a navigation bar with features including chats, meetings, and contacts. These features serve as **useful** tools that help users **effectively** use the app. When first opening the chat feature, Zoom includes directions on how users can utilize the chat.

When I first interacted with the chat feature, I immediately noticed the directions on how to start a new chat. Unfortunately, due to the poor layout, it took me longer to figure this step out than it should have. To make the interface more **effecient** I believe Zoom's interface could benefit from a "new chat" button or an icon that represents drafting a new message. Currently, Zoom has a small plus sign that is poorly located and can mislead users.

As shown above, the meetings feature shows users their schedule and when they have upcoming meetings. Personally, I don't have a crazy schedule filled with meetings but I can see how this feature is **useful** to those who actively use Zoom. The page displays your personal meeting number. This is a lengthy ten digit number that is similar to a phone number. I found that this number is rather difficult to remember and in order for users to share their meeting number with others they would have to check back on the meetings page. This creates an extra steps for users and could potentially lead to **errors** if users mistype their personal number. To make this feature more **memorable**, I believe Zoom could benefit from having users create their own meeting number or potentially have the number link to their phone number.  

All in all, Zoom has become wildly popular due to our current global situation. This platform is used by a wide range of users so it is important that the interface is optimized for **usability**.
